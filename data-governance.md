## Data Governance

*What is Data Governance?*

It is the ability to "govern" the data.  Who can access the data and what can they do with it are important questions in data governance.

Highlights of a Data Governance strategy include:

* Audit
    * Is there an automated auditing system?
    * How do you know when a security breach has occurred?
* PII
    * Is the system avoiding the storage of Personally Identifiable Information?
* Data Integrity
    * How are you ensuring that your data is not corrupted?
* Disaster Recovery
    * What is your disaster recovery plan and how do you know it works?  Did you test the backups?
* Encrypt
    * Do you encrypt data at transit and at rest?
* Model Explainability
    * Are you sure you could recreate the model?  Do you really know how it works and is it explainable.
