## Challenges and Opportunities in Distributed Systems



## Eventual Consistency

The foundational infrastructure of the cloud is built upon the concept of eventual consistency.

A good example of this is [Amazon DynamoDB](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html).  

## CAP Theorem

There is a tradeoff between consistency, availabilty and fault-tolerance.

## Amdahl's Law

There are diminishing returns with parallelization.

## Elasticity

The ability to adapt to a varying workload.  You should only pay for what you use.

## Highly Available

Does the system always respond with a healthy response?  A good example of a highly availability system is [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
